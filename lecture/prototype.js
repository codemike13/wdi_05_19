// Object.create allows you to create an object and whenever there's a failed property lookup on that object, it can consult another object to see if that other object has the property.

// Because child was created with Object.create(parent), whenever there's a failed property lookup on child, JavaScript will delegate that lookup to the parent object. What that means is that even though child doesn't have a heritage property, parent does so when you log child.heritage you'll get the parent's heritage which was Irish.
